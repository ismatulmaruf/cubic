            Performing the Hajj is a truly life-changing experience for Muslims.
            It is an opportunity to cleanse your soul, forgive others, and seek
            Allah's forgiveness. If you are considering performing the Hajj
            pilgrimage, Cubic Overseas encourages you to research Hajj packages
            and choose one that is right for you.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
            Cubic Overseas would also like to add that it is important to choose
            a Hajj package from a reputable tour operator. There are many
            fraudulent tour operators that prey on pilgrims and offer packages
            that do not deliver on their promises. Be sure to do your research
            and read reviews before choosing a Hajj package.
